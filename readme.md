## BPMN üë®‚Äçüíº

We use BPMN and Camunda to automise cancellation of flights and cars. If the process is somehow interrupted, we have timers in Camunda that will make an external service call to cancel the flight booking, and car booking if one is made. Otherwise the user has the choice to cancel the booking at the end of the process if they change their mind.
